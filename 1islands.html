                        <p>Kauaʻi is Hawaiʻi's fourth largest island and is sometimes called the "Garden Island,"
                 which is an entirely accurate description. The oldest and northernmost island in the 
                 Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs 
                 aged by time and the elements. Centuries of growth have formed tropical rainforests, 
                 forking rivers and cascading waterfalls! Some parts of Kauaʻi are only accessible by 
                 sea or air, revealing views beyond your imagination. More than just dramatic beauty, 
                 the island is home to a variety of outdoor activities. You can kayak the Wailua River, 
                 snorkel on Poʻipū Beach, hike the trails of Kōkeʻe State Park, or go ziplining above
                  Kauaʻi's lush valleys. But, it is the island's laid-back atmosphere and rich culture 
                  found in its small towns that make it truly timeless. Explore the regions of Kauaʻi 
                  and make your escape to discover the undeniable allure of the island. This is island 
                  is know for its abundance in wild turkey, roosters, and hen that roam the gardens and 
                  wake call out early in the morning</p><br>

            <p class = "t">Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” Oʻahu certainly lives up to its name. The third largest 
                Hawaiian island is home to the majority of Hawaiʻi’s diverse population, a fusion of East and West cultures
                 rooted in the values and traditions of the Native Hawaiian people. It’s this fundamental contrast between the 
                 ancient and the modern that makes discovering Oʻahu — from bustling city life to laidback surf towns — so enjoyable. 
                 You'll find plenty of different options for exploring Oʻahu's different regions, the island's many activities, its 
                 eclectic restaurants and accommodationz.</p><br>

            <td>
            <p>Hawaiʻi’s fifth largest island, Molokaʻi is only 38 miles long and 10 miles across at its widest point and is home 
                to the highest sea cliffs in the world and the longest continuous fringing reef. Molokaʻi remains true to its 
                island roots, with a high percentage of its population being of Native Hawaiian ancestry who continue to 
                preserve their rural lifestyle thanks to their love of the land. Whether you’re led by a guide along the cliffs
                 leading to Kalaupapa National Historical Park or discovering Pāpōhaku Beach, one of Hawaiʻi’s largest white-sand 
                 beaches, Molokaʻi is truly an island of outdoor adventure where Hawaiʻi’s past comes alive! Check out the
                  regions of Molokaʻi for yourself.</p><br></td>

                    two places. The first is found in luxurious resorts where visitors can indulge in world-class 
                    amenities and championship-level golf. The other is found bouncing along the island’s rugged back 
                    roads in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle to explore off-the-beaten-path treasures. You’re sure to 
                    find serenity, adventure and privacy on any of the three regions of Lānaʻi.</p><br></td>

                        from Haleakalā. It’s not surprising Maui has been voted "Best Island in the U.S." by Condé Nast Traveler

                        Nearly twice as big as all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined (hence, its nickname, “Big Island”),
                         its sheer size is awe-inspiring. You can travel through all but four of the world's different climate 
                         zones here, ranging from Wet Tropical to Polar Tundra, a result of the shielding effect and elevations of the
                          massive volcanoes Maunakea and Maunaloa. From the many geological features at Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park 
                          to the snow-capped heights of Maunakea; from the lush valleys of the Hilo and Hāmākua Coasts to the jet-black 
                          sands of Punaluʻu Beach, the island of Hawaiʻi is an unrivaled expression of the power of nature. However you
