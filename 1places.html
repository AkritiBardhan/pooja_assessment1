            <td><p>Pearl Harbor is a National Historic Landmark and active military base that earned its place in history for the 1941 attack, which killed 1,177 servicemen on the USS Arizona. The site is now home to several attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however reservations are recommended due to its popularity.

                The Pearl Harbor Visitor Center has free admission and is the meeting place for tours, including transportation to the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, where visitors can see WWII aircraft and artifacts, as well as experience landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier in a flight simulator.</p></td>

            <td><p>The Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park on the island of Kauai contains some of the world's most dramatic landscapes.
                These were made famous in the film Jurassic Park, which shows a dramatic coastline with cliffs that seem to ripple and 
                the "Wall of Tears" on Mount Waialeale, named for the way in which hundreds of waterfalls weep from the slopes of the mountain.
               Some of the best ways to take in the scene are to approach by water or to take a helicopter tour to view the simply breathtaking
                sight from above. Expert hikers can try the Kalalau Trail, an eleven-mile trek, which traverses five valleys and takes a full 
                day each way</p>.</td>

            <td><p>Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, Volcanoes National Park offers a unique, close-up look at an active volcano system where 
                lava seeps from fissures in the earth. The surrounding landscape is shaped by cooled lava rock, both old and new, which has 
                flowed over roads in a display of its unstoppable force. The park's centerpiece, Kilauea, has been active in recent years,
                 including an eruption in January 2021 that formed a lava lake. Visitors should be aware that portions of the park are closed 
                 during periods of seismic activity that might pose a threat. The park has many things to see and do, including the Thurston 
                 Lava Tube, Devastation Trail, and the steaming Halema'uma'u crater. During the area's most active periods, tourists have the
                  chance of experiencing the thrill of feeling seismic activity, hearing the boom of gas emissions, or even seeing a pillar of 
                  ash escaping into the air.</p></td>

            <td><p>Located on Maui, Haleakala National park offers access to the inactive Haleakala Volcano, which stands at 
                over 10,000 feet. Views from the summit stretch across the entire island and are particularly beautiful at sunrise.
                The dormant crater is exposed, showing a lunar-like landscape, while other areas of the park are covered 
                in subtropical rain forests, which are home to endangered species. Visitors can explore the many hiking trails 
                freely or sign up for guided ranger-led tours, and the more adventurous can spend the night in the park, 
                surrounded by one of Hawaii's most impressive landscapes.</p></td>

            <td><p>Waikiki, with its beautiful stretch of oceanfront beach, is Hawaii's biggest tourist attraction. 
                A suburb of Honolulu, Waikiki is popular for its big resorts, dining, entertainment, and shopping.
                The Waikiki Historic Trail includes historic markers made of surfboards, inspired by Waikiki's own Duke 
                Kahanamoku, an Olympic gold medalist swimmer and avid surfer. The boardwalk, known as the Waikiki Beach Walk,
                 is lined with cafes and entertainment venues, while Kuhio and KalaKaua Avenues are where the bulk of the area's 
                 restaurants and boutiques can be found. Diamond Head State Monument sits at the end of the 
                 crescent-shaped beach, creating a distinctive profile on the coastline. It was once an important 
                 vantage point for the island's coastal defense, and a steep hike to the top brings you to the old 
                 bunkers and artillery control station and rewards your efforts with panoramic views.</p></td>
