            <h2>Hawaiian animals</h2>
            <p>The animals in Hawaii are truly unique.  Not only is Hawaii one of the most diverse landscapes
                 in the world, but is also the most isolated.  As a result, the variety of wildlife here is quite
                  diverse.If you’re planning a trip to Hawaii, or even if you live here but don’t get into nature
                   much, it’s worth knowing the unique and interesting animals that populate these islands. 
                   To help you out, we’ve compiled this list of the top 10 most interesting animals in Hawaii.
                    Be sure to check them out the next time you’re in the mountains or in the ocean.</p>

                        There are only two mammals native to the island of Hawaii. One is the Hawaiian monk seal, 
                        the state mammal of Hawaii. These seals can be hard to find and almost went extinct in the
                         1990’s. Since that time, they have bounced back. Seals can weigh anywhere from 400-600 
                         pounds, and can be up to 8 feet in length.  The Hawaiian Monk Seal is one of only two 
                         remaining species of monk seals in the world.  The other is the Mediterranean Monk Seal.
                        Unfortunately the third species, the Caribbean Monk Seal, has gone extinct.
                        If you want to catch a glimpse of the Hawaiian monk seal, you can do so by taking a wildlife
                         tour. Sightings are not guaranteed, but if you’re lucky you just might spot the graceful
                          animal.  We’ve even been able to do so during our Dolphins and You tours, which is always 
                          a big treat for our guests!</p></td>

                    <td><p>The Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus semotus),[2][3] also known as ʻōpeʻapeʻa, is a species of bat endemic to the islands of Hawaiʻi.[4][5] Whereas the mainland hoary bat (L. cinereus) is found throughout North America, the Hawaiian hoary bat is distributed only among the major volcanic islands of Hawaiʻi, making it the only extant and native terrestrial mammal in the state; although some studies also posit that the mainland hoary bat lives in sympatry on the Hawaiian Islands alongside the Hawaiian hoary bat, this has been disputed.[4][6] The Hawaiian hoary bat was officially named the state land mammal of Hawaiʻi in 2015.[4] It is a federally listed endangered taxon of the United States.[1]

                        Like many species of bats, Hawaiian hoary bats are brown in color. However they are distinguished by the silver coloration that ‘frosts’ the fur on their back, ears, and neck.[7] They typically weigh between 14 to 18 g (0.49 to 0.63 ounces), and have a wingspan of about 10.5 to 13.5 inches, with females being larger than males.[7] They are insectivorous, nocturnal, and forage and hunt using echolocation.[4] They are a solitary subspecies and roost individually rather than in colonies. They are found throughout a large range of different habitats - forests, agricultural fields, and areas populated with humans.[8] Due to their elusive and solitary nature, there is very limited knowledge on the ecology or life history of the bat. As of now, population sizes are unknown, which is problematic because this data is necessary for species recovery plans. Currently the Hawaiian hoary bat is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.[9]
                        
                        Regarding conservation, the Hawaiian hoary bat faces a number of possible threats including: habitat loss, collisions with man-made structures such as wind turbines and barbed wire, impact of pesticides on primary food source, predation and competition with invasive species, and roost disturbance and tree cover reduction.</p></td>
